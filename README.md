# Cat-API
This project is a full-stack application consisting of a RESTful API and a simple frontend that displays a list of cats. The backend exposes secure, well-structured API endpoints to manage cat data stored in a database, while the frontend consumes these APIs using JavaScript and renders the results in the browser.
